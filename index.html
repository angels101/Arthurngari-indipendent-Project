            <P>“I am a dedicated person in a family of four. I enjoy reading, and the knowledge and perspective that my reading gives me has strengthened my public address skills and presentation abilities. 
                I have been successful at running a business, and I attribute this success to my ability to plan, schedule, and handle many different tasks at once. This flexibility will help me in the classroom,
                 where there are many different personalities and learning styles.”</p>
                 <p>I decided to join moringa as a challanges due to curiosity on computer and computer science</p>
